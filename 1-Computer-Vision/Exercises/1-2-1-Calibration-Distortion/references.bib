@article{Bauer:12,
	abstract = {A distortion mapping and computational image unwarping method based on a network interpolation that uses radial basis functions is presented. The method is applied to correct distortion in an off-axis head-worn display (HWD) presenting up to 23\% highly asymmetric distortion over a 27{\textdegree}x21{\textdegree} field of view. A 10{\textminus}5 mm absolute error of the mapping function over the field of view was achieved. The unwarping efficacy was assessed using the image-rendering feature of optical design software. Correlation coefficients between unwarped images seen through the HWD and the original images, as well as edge superimposition results, are presented. In an experiment, images are prewarped using radial basis functions for a recently built, off-axis HWD with a 20{\textdegree} diagonal field of view in a 4:3 ratio. Real-time video is generated by a custom application with 2 ms added latency and is demonstrated.},
