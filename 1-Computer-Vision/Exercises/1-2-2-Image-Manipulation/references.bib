	abstract = {Normal human color perception is a product of three independent sensory systems. By mirroring this mechanism, full-color display devices create colors as mixtures of three primaries. Any displayable color can be described by the corresponding values of these primaries. Frequently it is more convenient to define various other color spaces, or coordinate systems, for color representation or manipulation. Several such color spaces are presented which are suitable for applications involving user specification of color, along with the defining equations and illustrations. The use of special color spaces for particular kinds of color computations is discussed.},
