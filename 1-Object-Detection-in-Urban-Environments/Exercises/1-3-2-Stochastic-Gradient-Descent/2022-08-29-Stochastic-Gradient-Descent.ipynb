    "The logistic regression solver we have selected for this assignment is called [_stochastic gradient descent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) (SGD). Stochastic gradient descent is used as an iterative optimisation technique for solving the [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) problem when a closed-form solution does not exist (as in logistic regression). In essence, SGD iteratively estimates the parameters of a discrete probability distribution given a set of input observations. _Stochastic_ here implies that a batch size of $1$ is used. That is, on every weight update step only a single training example is used to compute the gradients. This differs from _batch_ or _mini-batch_ gradient descent, which use the full, or subset of the full datasets, on each update step.\n",
