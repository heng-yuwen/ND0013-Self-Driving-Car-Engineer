    "_Pooling layers_ are fundamental building blocks in [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) architectures. These intermediate layers are used in CNNs to reduce the dimentionality of input data. Pooling layers function by aggregating an input's spatial information in a process akin to [downsampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downsampling_\\(signal_processing\\)). By reducing the dimensionality of the input data, pooling layers help mitigate kernel sensitivity to granular features (finer details). As the input data is aggregated and its area reduced in size, the convolution kernels of a predefined size are able to cover a larger subregion within the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers, like their convolutional counterparts, operate over an input using a sliding-window approach. Because of this, pooling layers share several parameters â€” a _window size_ (the height, width dimensions of the _pooling window_) and a _stride_ amount (number of pixels to shift the centre of the sliding window on each iteration). These hyperparameters allow practitioners to control how much spatial resolution to reduce from the input data."

    "A kernel with this type of mismatch will tend to \"overshoot\" the bounds of the input and lead to an _incomplete_ window of pixel values (shown in red). When this happens, the standard practice is to _discard_ the window and _drop_ all pixel values in that window segment. When using the TensorFlow [`tf.nn.convolution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/convolution) or [`tf.nn.pool`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/pool) operations, this is the expected behaviour when using the [`padding='VALID'`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn#valid_padding_2) argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "While losing a few windows of computation might not seem like much, this affect gets compounded as more and more convolution or pooling layers are added to a network. With modern networks having handfuls of these layers, this can add up to a significant, unexpected reduction in resolution as your images pass through the network. To give [some perspective](https://blog.paperspace.com/padding-in-convolutional-neural-networks/), suppose we have a CNN with just four convolution layers and a kernel size of $3x3$. When we apply these layers to a $\\left(28, 28\\right)$ input image (e.g., an MNIST dataset image), we end up at the end with a $\\left(20, 20\\right)$ image. By reducing the image down to this size, we lose a total of _eight rows and columns_. This is equivalent to a loss of nearly *28%* of the original image *along each dimension*. All together, we have a total pixel loss of a whopping **49%** â€” and that's not even factoring in our intended downsampling!\n",
    "\n",
    "To circumvent this behaviour, padding is added to the edges of the input to \"fill in\" the missing values in the window. We described above two techniques for padding: _zero padding_ (left) or _[nearest-neighbour interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation) padding_ (right):"
