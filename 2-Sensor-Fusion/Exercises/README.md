# Exercise C1-5-5

## Files to work in:
- `basic_loop.py` 
- `lesson1-lidar-sensor/exercises/starter/l1_exercises.py`

Implement the `vis_intensity_channel()` function.

## Running the Code

Run `python basic_loop.py` from within the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory when you have implemented your code.

Note that you'll need to make use of the Desktop window (see button in bottom right of the workspace if working directly in the terminal) to view the visualization output, and use the Escape key to progress through frames.


# Exercise C1-5-2

## Files to work in:
- `basic_loop.py` 
- `lesson1-lidar-sensor/exercises/starter/l1_exercises.py`

Implement the `print_pitch_resolution()` function.

## Running the Code

Run `python basic_loop.py` from within the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory when you have implemented your code.


# Exercise C1-3-1

## Files to work in: 
- `basic_loop.py` 
- `lesson1-lidar-sensor/exercises/starter/l1_exercises.py`

Now that you are familiar with the starter code, please try to solve the following exercise: 
- In `basic_loop.py`, parameterize the code to load sequence 1 and start the loop with frame 1. 
- Pass the current frame to function `print_no_of_vehicles` in file `l1_exercises.py`. 
- Write code to find out how many objects of type "vehicle" have been provided as ground-truth labels for the LiDAR sensors in this frame and print the result. 

## Running the Code

Run `python basic_loop.py` from within the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory when you have implemented your code.
