@article{least-squares-umeyama,
	abstract = {In many applications of computer vision, the following problem is encountered. Two point patterns (sets of points) (x/sub i/) and (x/sub i/); i&#x3D;1, 2, . . ., n are given in m-dimensional space, and the similarity transformation parameters (rotation, translation, and scaling) that give the least mean squared error between these point patterns are needed. Recently, K.S. Arun et al. (1987) and B.K.P. Horn et al. (1987) presented a solution of this problem. Their solution, however, sometimes fails to give a correct rotation matrix and gives a reflection instead when the data is severely corrupted. The proposed theorem is a strict solution of the problem, and it always gives the correct transformation parameters even when the data is corrupted.},

@inproceedings{biber2003normal,
	abstract = {Matching 2D range scans is a basic component of many localization and mapping algorithms. Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the normal distributions transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM). First results on real data demonstrate, that the algorithm is capable to map unmodified indoor environments reliable and in real time, even without using odometry data.},
