# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
## Course 3: Localization
#### By Jonathan L. Moran (jonathan.moran107@gmail.com)
From the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme offered at Udacity.

This is Course 3: Localization in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme taught by Aaron Brown, Tiffany Huang and Maximilian Muffert of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America (MBRDNA).


### Course Objectives
* Develop a strong intuition of robotic localization;
* Derive the Bayes' Filter using a Markov assumption;
* Implement the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) scan matching algorithms;
* Localize a simulated vehicle with LiDAR point cloud data in the [CARLA Simulator](https://carla.org/).

### Learning Outcomes
#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Localization
* Understand how self-driving vehicles leverage GPS or object detections to localise itself in an environment;
* Predict vehicle motion using the [Kinematic Bicycle Motion](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/Control/BicycleModel.html) model.

#### Lesson 2: Markov Localization
* Apply the law of total probability to robotic motion;
* Derive the general Bayes' Filter with Markov assumption;
* Implement a 1D localisation programme in C++.

#### Lesson 2.5: Introduction to Point Cloud Library
* Familiarise yourself with the [PCL](https://pointclouds.org/) library;
* Learn about the basics of PCL, e.g., the PCD file type and the PCL Viewer;
* Create and use LiDAR objects in PCL;
* Learn the relative PCL object [templates](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/) and pointers in C++;
* Modify LiDAR object properties and parameters, e.g., number of layers, add random noise.

#### Lesson 3: Creating Scan Matching Algorithms
* Learn how the [Iterative Closest Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point) (ICP) algorithm is used for localisation;
* Learn how the [Normal Distributions Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distributions_transform) (NDT) algorithm is used for localisation;
* Implement the ICP and NDT for 2D localisation in C++.

#### Lesson 4: Utilizing Scan Matching in 3D
* Align 3D point cloud maps using the ICP algorithm;
* Align 3D point cloud maps using the NDT algorithm;
* Create and use point cloud maps in the CARLA simulator.
