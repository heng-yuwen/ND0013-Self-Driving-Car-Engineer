NOTE: These instructions have been adapted for the `4-1-Motion-Planning-Decision-Making` repository created by Jonathan L. Moran (@jonathanloganmoran on GitHub).
To obtain a copy of the code used with this build script (minus the dependencies from the original starter code repository), visit:
https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/4-Planning/4-1-Motion-Planning-Decision-Making.

NOTE 2: These instructions are intended to be run on the Udacity workspace, i.e., the VM running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.

New terminal window
1. su - student
// Will say permission denied, ignore and continue 
2. cd /opt/carla-simulator/
3. SDL_VIDEODRIVER=offscreen ./CarlaUE4.sh -opengl

New terminal window:
4. git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c5-planning-starter.git
5. cd nd013-c5-planning-starter/project
6 ./install-ubuntu.sh
7. cd planner/

NOTE: Before running the next steps, modify the relevant code files as instructed in the project description. If referencing the repository by @jonathanloganmoran, you should copy over the following files:
* `behavior_planner_FSM.cpp` and `behavior_planner_FSM.h`;
* `cost_functions.cpp` and `cost_functions.h`;
* `motion_planner.cpp` and `motion_planner.h`;
* `planning_params.h`;
* `velocity_profile_generator.cpp` and `velocity_profile_generator.h`. 

Now, with the above files modified, proceed to build and execute the project with the following steps:
9. cmake .
10. make
11. cd nd013-c5-planning-starter/project
12. ./run_main.sh
// This will silently fail 
13. ctrl + C to stop 
14. ./run_main.sh again
15. Go to desktop mode to see CARLA


// If error bind is already in use, or address already being used
ps -aux | grep carla
kill id
