/* Updates the ego-vehicle state by evaluating the state transition function.
 *
 * If the desired goal-state is located inside an intersection / junction, then
 * the updated `goal` will be placed at a position behind the junction by the
 * pre-defined `_stop_line_buffer` amount. Otherwise, we assume the vehicle is
 * in a nominal state and can move freely. In this case, goal-state velocity is
 * set to the pre-defined `_speed_limit` w.r.t. the 2D components of the vehicle
 * heading.
 *
 * If `STOPPED` at a controlled intersection (i.e., with traffic light), the
 * ego-vehicle will proceed to a `FOLLOW_LANE` state once the traffic light is
 * not "Red" and a pre-defined amount of `_req_stop_time` has passed.
 *
 * NOTE: We assume that the motion controller is not yet implemented, therefore we
 * use a distance threshold to stop the vehicle in the `DECEL_TO_STOP` state.
 *
 * @param    ego_state            Current ego-vehicle state.
 * @param    goal                 Pose of the goal-state.
 * @param    is_goal_in_junction  Whether the goal-state is in a junction.
 * @param    tl_state             State of the traffic light.
