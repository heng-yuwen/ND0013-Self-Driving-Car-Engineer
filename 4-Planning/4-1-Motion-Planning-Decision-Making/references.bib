@article{LIANG2005312,
	abstract = {This paper presents a nonholonomic path planning method, aiming at taking into considerations of curvature constraint, length minimization, and computational demand, for car-like mobile robot based on cubic spirals. The generated path is made up of at most five segments: at most two maximal-curvature cubic spiral segments with zero curvature at both ends in connection with up to three straight line segments. A numerically efficient process is presented to generate a Cartesian shortest path among the family of paths considered for a given pair of start and destination configurations. Our approach is resorted to minimization via linear programming over the sum of length of each path segment of paths synthesized based on minimal locomotion cubic spirals linking start and destination orientations through a selected intermediate orientation. The potential intermediate configurations are not necessarily selected from the symmetric mean circle for non-parallel start and destination orientations. The novelty of the presented path generation method based on cubic spirals is: (i) Practical: the implementation is straightforward so that the generation of feasible paths in an environment free of obstacles is efficient in a few milliseconds; (ii) Flexible: it lends itself to various generalizations: readily applicable to mobile robots capable of forward and backward motion and Dubins' car (i.e. car with only forward driving capability); well adapted to the incorporation of other constraints like wall-collision avoidance encountered in robot soccer games; straightforward extension to planning a path connecting an ordered sequence of target configurations in simple obstructed environment.},

	abstract = {A framework of path planning for autonomous electric bus is presented. ArcGIS platform is utilized for map-building and global path planning. Firstly, a high-precision map is built based on GPS in ArcGIS for global planning. Then the global optimal path is obtained by network analysis tool in ArcGIS. To facilitate local planning, WGS-84 coordinates in the map are converted to local coordinates. Secondly, a double-layer finite state machine (FSM) is devised to plan driving behavior under different driving scenarios, such as structured driving, lane changing, turning, and so on. Besides, local optimal trajectory is generated by cubic polynomial, which takes full account of the safety and kinetics of the electric bus. Finally, the simulation results show that the framework is reliable and feasible for driving behavior planning and trajectory generation. Furthermore, its validity is proven with an autonomous bus platform 12 m in length.},

	abstract = {Behavior planning and decision-making are some of the biggest challenges for highly automated systems. A fully automated vehicle (AV) is faced with numerous tactical and strategical choices. Most state-of-the-art AV platforms are implementing tactical and strategical behavior generation using finite state machines. However, these usually result in poor explainability, maintainability and scalability. Research in robotics has raised many architectures to mitigate these problems, most interestingly behavior-based systems and hybrid derivatives. Inspired by these approaches, we propose a hierarchical behavior-based architecture for tactical and strategical behavior generation in automated driving. It is a generalizing and scalable decision-making framework, utilizing modular behavior blocks to compose more complex behaviors in a bottom-up approach. The system is capable of combining a variety of scenario- and methodology-specific solutions, like POMDPs, RRT* or learning-based behavior, into one understandable and traceable architecture. We extend the hierarchical behavior-based arbitration concept to address scenarios where multiple behavior options are applicable, but have no clear priority among each other. Then, we formulate the behavior generation stack for automated driving in urban and highway environments, incorporating parking and emergency behaviors as well. Finally, we illustrate our design in an explanatory evaluation.},

@inproceedings{8593871,
	abstract = {Robots that navigate among pedestrians use collision avoidance algorithms to enable safe and efficient operation. Recent works present deep reinforcement learning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation. However, they are implemented using key assumptions about other agents' behavior that deviate from reality as the number of agents in the environment increases. This work extends our previous approach to develop an algorithm that learns collision avoidance among a variety of types of dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular behavior rules. This work also introduces a strategy using LSTM that enables the algorithm to use observations of an arbitrary number of other agents, instead of previous methods that have a fixed observation size. The proposed algorithm outperforms our previous approach in simulation as the number of agents increases, and the algorithm is demonstrated on a fully autonomous robotic vehicle traveling at human walking speed.},

This coherent and comprehensive book unifies material from several sources, including robotics, control theory, artificial intelligence, and algorithms. The treatment is centered on robot motion planning, but integrates material on planning in discrete spaces. A major part of the book is devoted to planning under uncertainty, including decision theory, Markov decision processes, and information spaces, which are the 'configuration spaces' of all sensor-based planning problems. The last part of the book delves into planning under differential constraints that arise when automating the motions of virtually any mechanical system.

@techreport{dolgov-practical-2008,
	abstract = {We describe a practical path-planning algorithm that generates smooth paths for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robot's sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. Our approach has two main steps. The first step uses a variant of the well-known A* search algorithm, applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle, but with a modified state-update rule that captures the continuous state of the vehicle in the discrete nodes of A* (thus guaranteeing kinematic feasibility of the path). The second step then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. The path-planning algorithm described in this paper was used by the Stanford Racing Team's robot, Junior, in the Urban Challenge. Junior demonstrated flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads, with typical full-cycle replaning times of 50--300ms.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an efficient real-time autonomous driving motion planner with trajectory optimization is proposed. The planner first discretizes the plan space and searches for the best trajectory based on a set of cost functions. Then an iterative optimization is applied to both the path and speed of the resultant trajectory. The post-optimization is of low computational complexity and is able to converge to a higher-quality solution within a few iterations. Compared with the planner without optimization, this framework can reduce the planning time by 52% and improve the trajectory quality. The proposed motion planner is implemented and tested both in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle in three different scenarios. Experiments show that the planner outputs high-quality trajectories and performs intelligent driving behaviors.},
