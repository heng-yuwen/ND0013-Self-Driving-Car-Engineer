Implement a Cost Function in C++","metadata":{},"id":"be9fc66a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In previous quizzes, you designed a cost function to choose a lane when trying to reach a goal in the highway driving scenario:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{cost} = 1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\vert \\Delta d \\vert}{\\Delta s}}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\Delta d$ was the lateral distance between the goal lane and the final chosen lane, and $\\Delta s$ was the longitudinal distance from the vehicle current position to the goal position. \n\nIn this exercise, we will implement a cost function in C++ that also includes states for planning a lane change right or left (denoted $\\mathrm{PLCR}$ and $\\mathrm{PLCL}$, respectively). The cost function should incoporate these states. As input to the cost function, we have the following:\n* **Intended lane**: the intended lane for the given behaviour. For the $\\mathrm{PLCR}$, $\\mathrm{PCLC}$, $\\mathrm{LCR}$, and $\\mathrm{LCL}$, this corresponds to the lane immediately adjacent to the current (one lane over);\n* **Final lane**: the immediate resulting lane of the given behaviour. For $\\mathrm{LCR}$ and $\\mathrm{LCL}$, this would correspond to one lane over;\n* **Distance to the goal**: $\\Delta s$, the longitudinal distance from the vehicle to the goal;\n* **Goal lane**: lane in which the goal marker is situated.\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to modify the $\\vert \\Delta d \\vert$ in the equation above so that it satisfies:\n* $\\vert \\Delta d \\vert$ decreases when both the intended and final lane are closer to the goal lane;\n* Each possible behaviour state $\\mathrm{KL}$, $\\mathrm{PLCR}$ / $\\mathrm{PLCL}$, $\\mathrm{LCR}$ / $\\mathrm{LCL}$ has a unique cost;\n* The values produced by the cost function are in range $[0, 1]$.
