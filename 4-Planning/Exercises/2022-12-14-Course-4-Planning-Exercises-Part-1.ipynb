The `goal_lane` and speed value `s`, as well as the `traffic_speeds` vector are set in the `test_behaviour_planner.cc` file. We are also given two cost functions, which are implemented in `3_costs.cc`. To complete this exercise, we must:\n","1. **Implement the `choose_next_state` method** in the `3_vehicle.cc` class;\n","    * Note the Python implementation from the Sect. 1.2. \"Behaviour Planner — you should instead return the best trajectory of the best state, rather than the state itself;\n","2. **Select appropriate weight values for the provided cost functions in `3_costs.cc`**;\n","    * Use the vehicle state values from the `get_helper_data()` in your implementation;\n","3. **Evaluate the planner results**.\n","\n","This exercise has several functions already implemented. These include:\n","* `successor_states()`: Returns a vector of possible successor states given the current state evaluated with the Finite-State Machine;\n","* `generate_trajectories()`: Returns a vector of `Vehicle` objects representing each possible trajectory for the ego-vehicle — if no possible trajectories exist for the given state, this vector is of size `0`;\n","* `calculate_cost()`: Computes the cost for a given trajectory.\n","* `get_helper_data()`: Updates the lane indices given the proposed trajectory / manoeuvre."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"632dd59b","metadata":{},"source":["#### Testing the Behaviour Planner in C++"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"713cfcbf-109d-4a6a-8811-3a7277a47ace","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["// From J.
