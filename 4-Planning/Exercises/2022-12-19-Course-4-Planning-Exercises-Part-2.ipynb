It is not _complete_, meaning it does not always find a solution when one exists. Aside from this, Hybrid A* has been implemented in Stanford's _Junior_ [3], the [2007 DARPA Grand Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_\\(2007\\)) 2nd Place winner, to perform free-form navigation in abritrary environments (e.g., parking lots). In order to perform trajectory planning, the Hybrid A* algorithm explores / expands discrete states using continuous vehicle coordinates $<x, y, \\theta>$. A prediction $<x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, \\theta^{\\prime}>$ is made with respect to the vehicle heading, and the path selected by Hybrid A* is guided by two additional heuristics: _non-holonomic-without-obstacles_, and the _holonomic-with-obstacles_. In addition to the runtime-, behaviour-, manoeuvre execution- and obstacle distance-based costs of the standard A* search, the Stanford Junior team used these two differential constraints to account for the non-holonomic nature of the ego-vehicle w.r.t. its location, orientation and direction of motion. This heuristic aided Junior in approaching the goal state with the desired heading. The second differential motion heuristic, _holonomic-with-obstacles_, ignores the non-holonomic nature of the vehicle and emphasizes the shortest distance to the goal. This second heuristic is computed online via a dynamic programming algorithm in 2D, whereas the first heuristic is computed entirely offline for the entire 4D space (vehicle location, orientation, and direction of motion). The _non-holonomic-without-obstacles_ heuristic is said to be significantly more efficient than Euclidean distance as it takes into account vehicle orientation, however, this heuristic alone fails to produce executable trajectories in situations with U-shaped dead ends. The addition of the _holonomic-with-obstacles_ heuristic attempts to address this by discovering these obstacles and dead-ends in 2D, which is used to guide the more-expensive 3D search away from these areas [2].\n","\n","The Hybrid A* search uses analytic expansions based on the [Reed-Shepp model](http://lavalle.pl/planning/node822.html). This addresses the precision issue resulting from the discretisation of the vehicle control action space. The effect of steering angle discretisation on precision means that the grid resolution must be carefully selected such that a decent approximation of the exact continuous-coordinate goal state can be reached. A node in the tree is expanded by simulating a kinematic model of the car for a given control action over the time-step equal to the resolution of the grid. Then, for some nodes, the optimal Reed-Shepp path is computed from the current- to goal-state (assuming no obstacle-free environment). By selectively applying the Reed-Shepp expansion, this extension of the search tree yields signficant benefits in both planning time and accuracy [2]. Several other path-cost ([Voronoi Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#Engineering)) and local optimisation / smoothing functions are applied to the final path planner used in the Stanford _Junior_.

This differs from the unstructured environment — parking lots, for example, where pre-defined rules regarding how to move (e.g., direction of traffic flow, lane boundaries, speed limits) about are not always available or adhered to by others.\n","\n","Next, we move from the 2D Cartesian coordinate system to the [Frenet](https://fjp.at/posts/optimal-frenet/) coordinate system to describe vehicle position and movement in a more intuitive way. Movement along an arbitrary road surface is described in two dimensions: $d$-axis for side-to-side lateral movements and $s$-axis for longitudinal back-and-forth movements. If we let the centre of a given lane be the origin of our Frenet reference frame, we can represent curvy roads as straight paths. Any ego-vehicle offset in either the $d$- or $s$-axis will be relative to the refererence path followed by the ego-vehicle, and not just the absolute position in 2D Cartesian space. Therefore, we can more easily discern intended vehicle trajectories and design vehicle trajectories independent of the curvature of the road (assuming that a rough estimate of the road curvature is known a priori).\n","\n","Using the individual components of the Frenet coordinate frame — the longitudinal and lateral axes — we separate the vehicle trajectories in either axis in order to execute them in a dynamic world reference frame. To create a trajectory, we define both a _start_ and _goal_ state in three dimensions: $s$, $d$ and $t$. The start (initial) state in the lateral direction is denoted $d_{i}$, while the goal (final) state is denoted $d_{f}$. The same applies for the longitudinal direction $s_{i}$, $s_{f}$, respectively.
