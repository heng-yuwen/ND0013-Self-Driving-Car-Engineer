The _completness_ assumption asserts that if a solution exists, the motion planner is guaranteed to always find the solution. In scenarios where no solution exists, the algorithm will correctly report so.  The _optimality_ assumption asserts that, for a given cost function evaluating sequences of actions, the motion planner is guaranteed to always return a feasible (i.e., executable) sequence of actions with minimal cost. Several other assumptions exist for specific algorithms, namely the resolution completeness and probabilistic completeness in the case of sampling-based planning algorithms.  \n\nIn order to enforce these constraints, we need a well-defined problem — the [_configuration space_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_\\(physics\\)) defines all possible configurations a robot can make in the world coordinate frame. In a 2D environment, this corresponds to each and every position $\\left[x, y\\right]$. In 3D, we extend the 2D position to include an orientation angle $\\left[x, y, \\theta\\right]$. We must also define a _start_ and _goal configuration_; the start configuration $q_{\\mathrm{start}}$ is usually initialised from a localisation algorithm using sensor data, whereas the goal configuration $q_{\\mathrm{goal}}$ is selected w.r.t. the behaviour planner defining where to move and at which speed. In practise, motion planning problem definitions usually consider additional constraints, such as the sequence of actions predicted for non-vehicles and pedestrians, which can be obtained via map and traffic data as well as kinematic / physics-based models.","metadata":{},"id":"db882d6a-d7a8-427a-bd54-5f2bec85fdc0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Types of motion planning algorithms","metadata":{},"id":"9ce93a17-308d-4a64-aae1-591de982966a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Several well-known types motion planning algorithms are as follows:\n* [Combinatorial methods](http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/planning/ch6.pdf): combinatorial approaches to motion planning find paths through the continuous configuration space without resorting to approximations — for special classes such as 2D robot planning, combinatorial methods provide _complete_, efficient, approximation-independent solutions over sampling-based planning methods [1];\n    * Relies on a _roadmap_ assumption through cell decomposition (i.e., partitioning the search space into cells) and several properties regarding accessibility and connectivity of the discrete graph search sapce; \n* [Artificial potential fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning#Artificial_potential_fields): this type of reactive method defines obstacles as electrostatic point charges which generate potential fields — the robot navigates the anti-gravity field around e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, using a [navigation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_function).\n    * A disadvantage with this class of algorithms (aside from harmonic potential field-based implementations) is their sensitivity to local minima, which might prevent the planner from arriving at the intended goal state;\n* [Optimal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control): a set of methods for [trajectory optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory_optimization) using either [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) and principle of optimality assumption (in closed-loop), or [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations) (in open-loop);\n    * Solves both the motion planning and control input generation problems in one approach using dynamic vehicle model with a start- and end configuration;\n    * Here a sequence of control inputs (e.g., steering angle, throttle) are generated and optimised with a cost function relative to the configuration of the vehicle (e.g., maximising efficiency, maintaining safe distance to obstacles);\n    * Optimal control relies on numerical approximation methods, or [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)-based approaches for closed-loop control;\n* [Sampling-based methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning#Sampling-based_algorithms): unlike combinatorial approaches, these set of algorithms have a runtime that is not explicitly exponentially dependent on the dimensionality of the configuration space $C$ — sampling-based algorithms construct roadmaps using a less-elegant collision dectection test which is _probabilistically complete_.

The Hybrid A* search algorithm uses a modified state-update rule to capture the continuous state of the vehicle in the discretised map space (represented as nodes in the A* graph). This guarantees kinematic feasability of the generated trajectory. In other words, Hybrid A* finds a path that a vehicle can actually manoeuvre (e.g., smooth curve-based trajectories) which is favoured by vehicle motion models such as the [kinematic bicycle](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/Control/BicycleModel.html).","metadata":{},"id":"22fd8de2-b7d5-4260-beff-f9de2e18f3f4"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Applications in path planning","metadata":{},"id":"2f73a25a-1b65-4384-8c16-5394ff457792"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Unlike the standard A* algorithm, the Hybrid A* is *not* guaranteed to find an minimal-cost solution. It is not _complete_, meaning it does not always find a solution when one exists. Aside from this, Hybrid A* has been implemented in Stanford's _Junior_ [3], the [2007 DARPA Grand Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_\\(2007\\)) 2nd Place winner, to perform free-form navigation in abritrary environments (e.g., parking lots). In order to perform trajectory planning, the Hybrid A* algorithm explores / expands discrete states using continuous vehicle coordinates $<x, y, \\theta>$. A prediction $<x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, \\theta^{\\prime}>$ is made with respect to the vehicle heading, and the path selected by Hybrid A* is guided by two additional heuristics: _non-holonomic-without-obstacles_, and the _holonomic-with-obstacles_. In addition to the runtime-, behaviour-, manoeuvre execution- and obstacle distance-based costs of the standard A* search, the Stanford Junior team used these two differential constraints to account for the non-holonomic nature of the ego-vehicle w.r.t. its location, orientation and direction of motion. This heuristic aided Junior in approaching the goal state with the desired heading. The second differential motion heuristic, _holonomic-with-obstacles_, ignores the non-holonomic nature of the vehicle and emphasizes the shortest distance to the goal. This second heuristic is computed online via a dynamic programming algorithm in 2D, whereas the first heuristic is computed entirely offline for the entire 4D space (vehicle location, orientation, and direction of motion). The _non-holonomic-without-obstacles_ heuristic is said to be significantly more efficient than Euclidean distance as it takes into account vehicle orientation, however, this heuristic alone fails to produce executable trajectories in situations with U-shaped dead ends. The addition of the _holonomic-with-obstacles_ heuristic attempts to address this by discovering these obstacles and dead-ends in 2D, which is used to guide the more-expensive 3D search away from these areas [2].\n\nThe Hybrid A* search uses analytic expansions based on the [Reed-Shepp model](http://lavalle.pl/planning/node822.html). This addresses the precision issue resulting from the discretisation of the vehicle control action space. The effect of steering angle discretisation on precision means that the grid resolution must be carefully selected such that a decent approximation of the exact continuous-coordinate goal state can be reached. A node in the tree is expanded by simulating a kinematic model of the car for a given control action over the time-step equal to the resolution of the grid. Then, for some nodes, the optimal Reed-Shepp path is computed from the current- to goal-state (assuming no obstacle-free environment). By selectively applying the Reed-Shepp expansion, this extension of the search tree yields signficant benefits in both planning time and accuracy [2]. Several other path-cost ([Voronoi Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#Engineering)) and local optimisation / smoothing functions are applied to the final path planner used in the Stanford _Junior_.
