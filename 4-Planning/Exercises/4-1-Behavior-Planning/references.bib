	abstract = {This article describes the robot Stanley, which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Stanley was developed for high-speed desert driving without human intervention. The robot's software system relied predominately on state-of-the-art AI technologies, such as machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. This article describes the major components of this architecture, and discusses the results of the Grand Challenge race.},

	abstract = {The DARPA Grand Challenge is a field test designed to accelerate R&D in autonomous ground vehicles that save lives on the future battlefield. At Ohio State University, we have extensive experience in developing autonomous ground vehicles. Our goal was to create a completely autonomous vehicle that could negotiate most of the GC 04 route and perhaps even finish the race. To achieve our goal, we needed to conquer three main technical challenges. The first was to install drive-by-wire technology in the vehicle and to modify the vehicle to fulfill DARPA safety requirements. The second challenge was to provide sensing and information fusion algorithms. The third challenge was control.},
