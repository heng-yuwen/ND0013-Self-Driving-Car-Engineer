### Learning Outcomes
#### Lesson 1: Behavior Planning
* Design high-level behaviour planning systems for the self-driving car;
* Use Finite State Machines to model vehicle / environment states and transitions;
* Design weighted cost functions in C++;
* Implement a behaviour planner in C++.

#### Lesson 2: Trajectory Generation
* Use the C++ [`Eigen`]() library to design candidate trajectories in C++;
* Design and implement the [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and Hybrid A* search algorithms in C++;
* Perform trajectory matching and structured trajectory generation;
* Implement the quintic and polynomial solvers in C++;
* Study state-of-the-art path planning nets (e.g., [DeepTraffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02805)).


#### Lesson 3: Motion Planning
* Familiarise yourself with direct trajectory generation and path / velocity planning;
* Implement polynomial splines / sprials problem using Simpson's Rule in C++;
* Implement offset goals / boundary conditions in C++;
* Perform numerical approximation using discretisation;
* Design and implement velocity profiles in C++;
* Design and implement circle-based collision detection.
