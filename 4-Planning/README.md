## Course 4: Planning
#### By Jonathan L. Moran (jonathan.moran107@gmail.com)
From the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme offered at Udacity.

This is Course 4: Planning in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme taught by Benjamin Ulmer and Tobias Roth of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development.


### Course Objectives
* Design weighted cost functions and implement a behaviour planner in C++;
* Use a [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) to model vehicle / environment states and transitions;
* Implement a behaviour and motion planner in Python and C++.
