@conference{Berjoza:2008,
	abstract = {The parameters impacting vehicle kinematics of turn - a time period needed for turning a steering wheel, a ratio of vehicle wheel track and wheel bases were analysed. By using a model, the entering of turns by vehicles and semitrailers was researched. The momentary turning centres for vehicles and semitrailers diverged, depending on the researched turning radiuses. All vehicles with semitrailers, when turning, move along a circle after a 90 deg turn is performed. Articulated vehicles are an exception - their movement along a circle is possible only at large turning radiuses. It can be explained by the fact that semitrailers have large wheelbases.},

@article{Farag:2020aa,
	abstract = {In this paper, a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller that facilitates track maneuvering for self-driving cars is proposed. Three different design approaches are used to find and tune the controller hyper-parameters. One of them is ``WAF-Tune'', which is an ad hoc trial-and-error based technique that is specifically proposed in this paper for this specific application. The proposed controller uses only the Cross-Track-Error (CTE) as an input to the controller, whereas the output is the steering command. Extensive simulation studies in complex tracks with many sharp turns have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller at different speeds. The analysis shows that the proposed technique outperforms the other ones. The usefulness and the shortcomings of the proposed tuning mechanism are also discussed in details.},
