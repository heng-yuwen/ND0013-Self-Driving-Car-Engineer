	abstract = {In this paper, the three principal control effects found in present controllers are examined and practical names and units of measurement are proposed for each effect. Corresponding units are proposed for a classification of industrial processes in terms of the two principal characteristics affecting their controllability. Formulas are given which enable the controller settings to be determined from the experimental or calculated values of the lag and unit reaction rate of the process to be controlled. These units form the basis of a quick method for adjusting a controller on the job. The effect of varying each controller setting is shown in a series of chart records. It is believed that the conceptions of control presented in this paper will be of assistance in the adjustment of existing controller applications and in the design of new installations.},

	abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a theoretical study of the control of a single-capacity process with dead-period lag. Characteristic equations corresponding to the application of proportional, proportional-plus-derivative, proportional-plus-reset, and proportional-plus-reset-plus-derivative responses are used to graph the controller parameters necessary to obtain a desired degree of stability. The degree of stability is taken to be associated with the amplitude ratio of the lowest-frequency harmonic mode. Effects of the various controller parameters are shown and a method is suggested to determine the adjustable parameters for a desired degree of stability.}},

	abstract = {The paper describes procedures for automatic tuning of regulators of the PID type to specifications on phase and amplitude margins. The key idea is a simple method for estimating the critical gain and the critical frequency. The procedure will automatically generate the appropriate test signal. The method is not sensitive to modelling errors and disturbances. It may be used for automatic tuning of simple regulators as well as initialization of more complicated adaptive regulators.},
