# Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
## Course 5: Control
#### By Jonathan L. Moran (jonathan.moran107@gmail.com)
From the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme offered at Udacity.

This is Course 5: Control in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree programme taught by David Siller, Andrew Gray and Sebastian Thrun.


### Course Objectives
* Design throttle- and steering-command controllers to perform vehicle trajectory tracking;
* Implement Proportional, Proportional-Derivative (PD), and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in Python and C++;
* Test the PID controller efficacy in the CARLA Simulator.


### Demo Notebooks

### Projects
* ✅ [Project 5.1: Control and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/5-Control/5-1-Control-Trajectory-Tracking).


### Exercises
* ✅ [5.1 PID Control](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/5-Control/Exercises/5-1-PID-Control).


### Course Contents
The following topics are covered in course exercises:
* Vehicle state (position / velocity) and control variables (steering, acceleration, braking);
* Feedback controllers (PID, MPC) for trajectory tracking;
* Stability in the non-linear case;
* Controller robustness to real-world perturbations;
* More info coming soon... 

Other topics covered in course lectures and reading material:
* Basics of feedback controllers;
* Various controller principles (P-, PI- PID-controllers);
* More info coming soon...


### Learning Outcomes
#### Lesson 1: PID Control
* Define the vehicle observation (position, velocity) and action (steering, acceleration, braking) states of the vehicle;
* Design and code the PID controller in Python and C++;
* Design and code the MPC in C++;
* Evaluate the efficicacy of several controller types for autonomous vehicles using CARLA Simulator.
