### Contents
The following topics are covered in course projects:

##### Course 1: Computer Vision
* Training a SSD object detection model on the Waymo Open Dataset in TensorFlow
* Fine-tuning strategies and making architectural optimisations for DNNs
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training / evaluation error analysis
* And so much more ... (see [1-Computer-Vision](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/1-Computer-Vision) for full list of course topics).

##### Course 2: Sensor Fusion
* Extract and transform LiDAR range images into 3D point clouds and bird's-eye view (BEV) maps;
* Build and experiment with state-of-the-art 3D object detection nets;
* And so much more ... (see [2-Sensor-Fusion](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/2-Sensor-Fusion) for full list of course topics).

##### Course 3: Localization
* Master robot localisation from one-dimensional motion models to three-dimensional point cloud maps;
* Master the fundamentals of Bayes' theorem and the Markov assumption applied to robot localisation;
* Implement Markov localisation to perform 1D object tracking in C++;
* Write and optimise two scan matching algorithms in C++: Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT);
* Apply the scan matching algorithms to simulated LiDAR point clouds processed with the Point Cloud Library (PCL);
* And so much more ... (see [3-Localization](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/3-Localization) for full list of course topics).
